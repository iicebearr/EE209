Comparison of Implementation Method:
 Implementation by array becomes slow is when dealing with
 a large number of user items as adding, deleting, and searching of
 a user item depends on linear search.

 However, implementation by hash table is fast even when dealing with
 a large number of user items as adding, deleting, and searching of
 a user item does not depend on the number of user items
 (for a good hash function).

 Although, hash table is more difficult to implement and maintain
 as it requiires a lot of memory allocation.

Hash table expansion is not implemented.
